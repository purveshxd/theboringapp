### Basic Overview

Made this when I had to do a fun project, which uses ***the bored api*** getting user different activities and then user could save it in the local storage.

### Development status

I've added everything I wanted to add for my personal needs. If requested, I can add more features, but unless I come up with more ideas on functionalities or find bugs while using it, the development will be on pause for now.
